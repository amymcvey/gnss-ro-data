    "# Demonstration of awsgnssroutils.database\n",
    "\n",
    "Authors: Amy McVey (amcvey@aer.com) and Stephen Leroy (sleroy@aer.com) \\\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates the functionality of the awsgnssroutils.database \n",
    "module, which contains utilities to query the AWS Registry of Open Data repository\n",
    "of GNSS radio occultation data. It does so using database files posted in the\n",
    "AWS repository. Specifically, the module defines two classes: *RODatabaseClient* and \n",
    "*OccList*. The former creates a gateway to the metadata on GNSS radio occultation \n",
    "(RO) soundings hosted in the AWS Registry of Open Data and enables a local mirror \n",
    "repository of that metadata if one is desired. The latter creates instances of \n",
    "lists of RO soundings and their associated metadata and offers several methods to \n",
    "manipulate those metadata and even download RO data files. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functionality\n",
    "This module defines two classes: RODatabaseClient and OccList. The first \n",
    "creates a portal to a database of RO metadata, and the second is an instance \n",
    "of a list of radio occultations (ROs). Each are described below. It is mandatory \n",
    "that a new user initialize a repository that tracks the history of prior searches. \n",
    "Doing so is necessary to accelerate the querying of RO metadata. **The user will \n",
    "encounter long search times the first time a segment of the database is queries. \n",
    "With the local repository of previous searches, subsequent queries along the same \n",
    "segment will be much shorter.** \n"
