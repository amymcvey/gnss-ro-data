Purpose:
These instructions will allow you to create your own DynamoDB table based on the GNSS RO Open Data json files.
With this you will be able to query and sort through the vast amounts of RO data in the Open Data bucket.

Prerequisites:
1. AWS console access
2. DynamoDB table created as such:
  A. Go to the dynamoDB Service in the AWS console
  B. Select "Create table"
  C. Table name = "gnss-ro-import"
  D. Partition key = "leo-ttt"
  E. Sort key = "date-time"
  F. Select Custom Settings
  G. Choose "Capacity mode" = On-demand
  H. Finish by selecting "Create table"


Instructions:
1. In your AWS console, go to the Data Pipeline Service
2. Click "create new pipeline"
3. Enter a Name and Description of your choice
4. For Source: choose "DynamoDB Templates" >> "Import DynamoDB backup data from S3"
5. Input s3 folder: s3://gnss-ro-data/dynamo/v1.1/export_subsets/
6. Target DynamoDB table name: "gnss-ro-import"  (must match the above table name)
7. DynamoDB write throughput ratio: 0.9
8. Region of the DynamoDB table: "us-east-1"
9. under Schedule, select Run "on pipeline activation"
10.Disable logging
11. Select "Activate" at the bottom.  The IAM roles should be created for you assuming the IAM role you are signed in as has permissions.


Note: this pipeline may take a bit to start up, but should import all data into the specified DynamoDB table in 2-4 hours.
