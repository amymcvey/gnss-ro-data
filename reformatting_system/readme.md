# NASA ACCESS 2019 - GNSS Radio Occultation Data in the AWS Cloud
Our ACCESS project was to make all GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) radio occultation available to the public in the AWS Open Data Registry from as many radio occultation (RO) retrieval centers as possible.  We were able to include the following processing centers in our data:
- UCAR
- The ROM SAF
- EUMETSAT
- JPL

The Open Data Registry is: https://registry.opendata.aws/gnss-ro-opendata/  

The following links will provide detailed information on the [AWS Architecture](terraform/readme.md) that was used to process this data and the [python code](docker/readme.md) used to reformat the radio occultation events.
